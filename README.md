**Chromium-based cross-platform / cross-language application framework**

*Thrust is `require/import`-able, it lets you distribute NodeJS, Go or Python GUI apps directly 
through their native package managers.*

Thrust is based on Chromium's Content Module and is supported on Linux, MacOSX and Windows:

## Language bindings

Thrust's binary distribution exposes its API on the standard IO and language
 specific library packages automatically download the binary distribution at 
installation. Thrust is based on Chromium's content module and uses web-pages 
as its GUI.

All these Getting Started example work as is on each major platform (MacOSX,
Windows, Linux)

### NodeJS
##### Getting Started

First install with `npm install node-thrust`

```Javascript
require('node-thrust')(function(err, api) { 
  api.window({ root_url: 'https://google.com' }).show();
});
```

##### Library

- **node-thrust** [breach/node-thrust](https://github.com/breach/node-thrust/)

### Go

##### Getting Started

First download with `go get -u github.com/miketheprogrammer/go-thrust/`

```Go
```
package main

import (
	"github.com/miketheprogrammer/go-thrust/lib/dispatcher"
	"github.com/miketheprogrammer/go-thrust/lib/spawn"
	"github.com/miketheprogrammer/go-thrust/lib/bindings/window"
	"github.com/miketheprogrammer/go-thrust/lib/commands"
)

func main() {
	spawn.Run()
	size := commands.SizeHW{}
	opts := window.Options{
		RootUrl:  "http://google.com",
		Size:     size,
		Title:    "Demo window",
		HasFrame: true,
	}
	thrustWindow := window.NewWindow(opts)
	thrustWindow.Show()
	thrustWindow.Maximize()
	thrustWindow.Focus()
	dispatcher.RunLoop()
}

##### Library

- **go-thrust**: [miketheprogrammer/go-thrust](https://github.com/miketheprogrammer/go-thrust)

### Python

##### Getting Started

First install with `pip3 install pythrust [--user]` (requires Python3)

```Python
import asyncio, pythrust

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
api = pythrust.API(loop)

asyncio.async(api.spawn())
asyncio.async(api.window({ 'root_url': 'http://google.com' }).show())

loop.run_forever()
```

##### Library

### Scala

##### Getting Started

Include scala-thrust jar on your classpath. (Add to lib in your project.)

```Scala
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
import com.github.eklavya.thrust._

object Main extends App {
  Window.create("http://google.com").foreach { w =>
    w.show
    w.maximize
    w.openDevtools
    w.focus(true)
    w.onBlur(() => println("we were blurred"))
    w.onFocus(() => println("we were focused"))
    Menu.create("MyMenu").foreach { m =>
      val i = MenuItem("Item1", _ => println("Item1 was clicked"))
      m.addItem(i)
      m.popup(w)
    }

- [Sample Project](https://github.com/solicode/clj-thrust#sample-project)

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [clj-thrust.core :refer [create-process destroy-process]]
            [clj-thrust.window :as w]))

(let [process (create-process) ; `create-process` also takes path to Thrust directory
      window (w/create-window process
               :root-url "http://localhost:8080" ; URL to your web app
               :size {:width 400 :height 300})]
  (w/listen-closed window
    (fn [e]
      (destroy-process process))) ; Optionally call `(System/exit 0)` here.
  (w/show window)
  (w/focus window true))
```

##### Library

- **clj-thrust** [solicode/clj-thrust](https://github.com/solicode/clj-thrust)

### Perl

##### Getting Started

Install with `cpanm Thrust [--sudo]`

Simple command line test:

```
perl -MThrust -e 'Thrust->window->show->maximize->open_devtools->run'
```

Basic program

```Perl
use Thrust;

my $t = Thrust->new;

my $w = $t->window(
          root_url => 'data:text/html,Hello World!',
          title => 'My App',
          size => { width => 800, height => 600 },
        );

$w->on(closed => sub { exit });

$w->show;

$t->run; ## enter event loop
```

## Building Thrust from Sources

You will generally don't need to build thrust yourself. A binary version of 
thrust should be automatically fetched by the library you're reyling on at 
installation.

To build thrust, you'll need to have `python 2.7.x` and `git` installed. You can 
then boostrap the project with:
```
./scripts/boostrap.py                                
```

Build both the `Release` and `Debug` targets with the following commands:
```
./scripts/update.py
./scripts/build.py
```

Note that `bootstrap.py` may take some time as it checks out `brightray` and
downloads `libchromiumcontent` for your platform.
